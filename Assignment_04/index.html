      <p>Whose woods these are I think I know. <br />
      His house is in the village though; <br />
      He will not see me stopping here <br />
      To watch his woods fill up with snow. <br />
      <br />
      My little horse must think it queer <br />
      To stop without a farmhouse near <br />
      Between the woods and frozen lake <br />
      The darkest evening of the year. <br />
      <br />
      He gives his harness bells a shake <br />
      To ask if there is some mistake. <br />
      The only other soundâ€™s the sweep <br />
      Of easy wind and downy flake. <br />
      <br />
      The woods are lovely, dark and deep, <br />
      But I have promises to keep,   <br />
      And miles to go before I sleep, <br />
      And miles to go before I sleep. </p>
