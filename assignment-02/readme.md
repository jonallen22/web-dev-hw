# Assignment 2
## Jon Allen

I decided to take this class because i really know nothing about how to code. I am not a tech savvy person in general, and this is a way for me to at least learn the basics of coding and setting up a website. I also am taking this class as I need the three credits to help graduate this spring.

1. I have learned how to use markdown language.
2. I have learned how to create files using coding language.
3. I hope to learn how to full create a working website.
